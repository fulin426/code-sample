## Sample Code for Airbnb Apprenticeship

Form created using React and https://reactstrap.github.io/.
A contact form that posts to an API, shows a success message afterwards, and with form input validation included. I decided to use this code sample because forms are often overlooked as easy, but reality there is a lot of logic that goes behind forms in React.
